all my life felt not quite right
i tried and tried, lost in the night
i did not know of what i sought
a nameless fear could not be fought

but i just gasped and sat up straight
a revelation, a loss of weight
i am a girl inside of me
it took 40 hard years to see

i want to mourn and snuff the flame
perhaps I can restart this game
a full life where i can be
no more him, but instead me

but i still have time in this shell
to craft a heaven, to play my bell
so i will stretch into my skin
for my real life can now begin
