<div class="poem">
  <p>
    All my life felt not quite right</br>
    I tried and tried, lost in the night</br>
    I did not know of what i sought</br>
    A nameless fear could not be fought
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I just gasped and sat up straight</br>
    A revelation, a loss of weight</br>
    It took 40 hard years to see</br>
    There is a girl inside of me
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I want to mourn, to snuff the flame</br>
    Perhaps I can restart this game</br>
    A full life where i can be</br>
    No more him, but instead me
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I still have time in this shell</br>
    To craft a heaven; to play my bell</br>
    So i will stretch into my skin</br>
    For my real life can now begin     
  </p>
