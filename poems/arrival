She was nothing, almost. 
A soundless whisper of thought
A dream that hasn’t happened
Yet!

She was not on his radar
He only scanned outside
Feeling his emptiness
She quietly built

She was in the dreams he didn’t remember
He didn’t realise
That gentle hands began to hold warmly from within

She was looking down
At her own hands 
He started to fade away
Smiling gently
