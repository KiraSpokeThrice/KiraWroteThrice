<p>
  
A shaft of light tears apart the night.   
A sonic smash of an awakening cry.   
The burning force of repurposed blood.   
The crushing weight of awoken dreams.   

Two peaks crack violently through the ribcage.   
A mound sinks back into the pelvis.   
Hips break apart to a wider stance.   
Silken tendrils swarm the scalp.   

A violent birth, 40 years in a blink.   
Vague memories snap into a complete picture.   
A name uncovered in the wreckage.   
And I watch her climb from the destruction, complete and untouched.
