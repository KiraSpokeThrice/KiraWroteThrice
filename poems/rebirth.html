<div class="poem">

<p>A shaft of light tears apart the night.</br>   
A sonic smash of an awakening cry.</br>
The burning force of repurposed blood.</br>   
The crushing weight of awoken dreams.</p>   

<p>Two peaks crack violently through the ribcage.</br>   
A mound sinks back into the pelvis.</br>   
Hips break apart to a wider stance.</br>   
Silken tendrils swarm the scalp.</p>   

<p>A violent birth, 40 years in a blink.</br>   
Vague memories snap into a complete picture.</br>   
A name uncovered in the wreckage.</br>   
And I watch her climb from the destruction, complete and untouched.</p>
